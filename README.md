This project is about a geometric method named as "Polyhedral Omega" for calculating results of linear equations with integer coefficients.
Project is being carried out by TÃ¼lay AYYILDIZ in Computer Science and Engineering Department, Gebze Technical University.
My job is writing Lean codes of the project.
